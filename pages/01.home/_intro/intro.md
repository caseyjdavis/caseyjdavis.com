# Casey Davis

I'm a systems administrator, network administrator and amateur radio operator. I'm currently an Application Support Specialist at Colorado Early Colleges where I focus on managing all the technology and information infrastructure at each of our twelve campuses, maintain the student information system, program and expand our DRM radio communications network and occasionally schedule a meeting. Previously I was an Systems Administrator at Poudre School District in Fort Collins, Colorado.

My degree is in Management Information Systems from the Jerry S. Rawl's College of Business Administration at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas. I have been a Red Raider since elementary school.

I live in Edgewater, Colorado.
